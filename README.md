My name is Fahad ([/fÃ¤hÉ‘Ã°/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=f%C3%A4h%C9%91%C3%B0&voice=Amy)). I'm a Software Engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I'm currently working at [@dh-health](https://dh.health). I'm also in the process of completing my undergrad at [AIUB](https://aiub.edu). Most of my professional experience has to do with creating reactive web apps using React and Node. I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax...) and I'm usually willing to pay the early-adopter tax if I think the tech is awesome.
