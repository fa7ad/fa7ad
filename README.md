My name is Fahad ([/fÃ¤hÉ‘Ã°/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=f%C3%A4h%C9%91%C3%B0&voice=Kimberly)). I'm a Software Engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I'm most experienced at creating reactive web apps using React and Node. I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax...) and I'm usually willing to pay the early-adopter tax if I think the tech is awesome.
