### Hi there 👋

My name is Fahad ([/fähɑð/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=f%C3%A4h%C9%91%C3%B0&voice=Kimberly)). I'm a Software Engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I'm most experienced at creating reactive web apps using React and Node. I enjoy learning about new technology (languages/frameworks/libraries/syntax...) and I'm usually willing to pay the early-adopter tax if I think the tech is awesome.

Here are some bullet points:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [a Reason+ReactNative based tic-tac-toe game](https://github.com/fa7ad/katakati)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [ReasonML](http://reasonml.github.io/)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on *any small JS library (that I can understand and find useful 😇 )*
- 💬 Ask me about *Prog & Death Metal Music, FP concepts and some cool JS libraries*
- 📫 How to reach me: *mail me at [setname.fahad+gh AT gmail.com](mailto:setname.fahad+gh@gmail.com)*
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
